# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Found a bug, typo, missing feature or a description that doesn't make sense or needs clarification?
Great, please let us know!

### Pull Requests

**Any pull request needs to be reviewed and approved by the Unfolded Circle API team.**

⚠️ Due to the nature of API specifications and their dependencies and impacts in our software, we can't accept every pull
request from the community. Please reach out to us first if you plan to make substantial changes.

Submitting pull requests for typos, formatting issues etc. are happily accepted and usually approved relatively quick.  
For other things, please talk to us first! API changes need to be discussed, reviewed and approved first by the API team.
The preferred way for API changes is to open a feature request or enhancement with your proposed changes, rather than
directly submitting a pull request, which we'll probably have to decline.

### Bug Reports :bug:

- If you find a bug, please search for it first in the [Issues](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/api-model-rs/issues), 
  and if it isn't already tracked, [create a new issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/api-model-rs/issues/new).  
- Issues that have already been submitted or identified as a bug will be labelled `bug`.

### New Features :bulb:

If you'd like to change or add new functionality to an existing API, please go to the
[Unfolded Circle Core API](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api) repository and open a
[new Issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/api-model-rs/issues/new) there.

If you'd like to add new functionality to a model, describe the problem you want to solve in a
[new Issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/api-model-rs/issues/new).
