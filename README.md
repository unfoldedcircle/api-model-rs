# Unfolded Circle API Models for Rust

This crate provides structs and enums for the [Unfolded Circle Remote Two](https://www.unfoldedcircle.com/) APIs.

The model can be used for user based Rust integration drivers. It is also being used in the Unfolded Circle remote-core
& simulator implementations to make sure it is up-to-date with the API specifications.
