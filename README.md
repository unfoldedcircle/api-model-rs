# Unfolded Circle API Models for Rust

This crate provides structs and enums for the [Unfolded Circle Remote Two](https://www.unfoldedcircle.com/) APIs.

It can be used for user based Rust integration drivers as the Home-Assistant integration.
_TODO_ add GitHub link once published!

The model is also being used in the remote-core & simulator implementations to make sure it is up-to-date with the API
specifications.
